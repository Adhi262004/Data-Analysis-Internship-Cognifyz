### Level 1 â€“ Task 3: Price Range Distribution

**Objective**:
- Visualize how restaurants are distributed across different price ranges (1 to 4).
- Calculate the percentage of restaurants in each category.

**Approach**:
- Used Pandas to count frequency of each price range using `value_counts()`.
- Calculated percentage distribution of each price range relative to total restaurants.
- Visualized the distribution using a bar chart with Matplotlib.
- Saved the plot as 'Price_Range_Distribution.png'.

**Insights**:
- Price range 2 and 3 had the highest number of restaurants.
- Fewer restaurants were in price range 1 (low-end) and 4 (premium).
