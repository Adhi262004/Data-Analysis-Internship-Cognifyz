### Level 2 – Task 3: Price Range vs Rating

**Objective**:
- Analyze how different price ranges relate to restaurant ratings.

**Approach**:
- Grouped restaurants by 'Price range'.
- Counted number of restaurants in each range.
- Calculated average rating per range.
- Visualized both metrics using a bar-line combination chart.

**Insights**:
- Most restaurants fall in Price Range 1.
- Higher price ranges tend to have slightly higher average ratings.
- Avg Rating increases from ~3.2 (low) to ~4.0 (high-end).

**Example**:
Price Range 1 — Many restaurants, Avg Rating: ~3.2  
Price Range 4 — Fewer restaurants, Avg Rating: ~4.0
